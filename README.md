### How to run

MIN is developed using HTML, CSS and Javascript and is based solely on standard features available in modern web browsers. MIN does not rely on any frameworks or back-end servers. However, you need to [create a simple local HTTP server](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Common_questions/set_up_a_local_testing_server) to load local data files.
